Home Location Register(HLR) is a database that contains data regarding authorized subscribers using a global system for mobile communication (GSM) core network. If there is a discrepancy of subscriber profiles and eligible services between HLRand Billing System of a Telco, there exists a possibility of a revenue leakage. The functionality of this software module is to decodeand extract the proprietary format data from Alcatel HLRs (there are 4 of them in Dialog Axiata PLC core-network) and fetch customer service data from the database of the Billing System to compare those in memory and write back the discrepancies to a database.
